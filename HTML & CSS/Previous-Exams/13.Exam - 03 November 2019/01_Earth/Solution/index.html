                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
                object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other
                sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's
                axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane,
                producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between
                Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its
                axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
